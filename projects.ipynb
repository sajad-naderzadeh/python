        " stands for First-Come, First-Served and is a scheduling algorithm used in operating systems and computer science. It is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm, which means that once a process starts executing, it will continue to do so until it finishes or is blocked.\n",
        "\n",
        "In FCFS, the processes are executed in the order in which they arrive in the ready queue. The first process that arrives is the first to be executed, and so on. This can lead to a phenomenon known as the \"convoy effect,\" where smaller processes are held up behind a larger process, causing potential delays.\n",

        "While FCFS is simple and easy to implement, it may not be the most efficient scheduling algorithm, especially for systems with a mix of short and long processes. It can lead to longer average waiting times and turnaround times compared to other scheduling algorithms like Round Robin or Shortest Job First.\n",
